# Key Insights: GenAI Churn Prevention System


INSIGHT #1: Extreme Churn Risk = Onboarding Problem
- 100% of customers with 85-95% churn risk are in "New" lifecycle (<12 months)
- This indicates a systematic onboarding issue, not individual retention issues
- Business Recommendation: Invest in proactive onboarding optimization rather than 
  reactive retention campaigns for this segment

INSIGHT #2: Success Rates are Data-Driven
- Low Risk (20-40%): 55-65% success rate
- Medium Risk (40-70%): 40-50% success rate  
- High Risk (70-95%): 30-45% success rate
- Success rates inversely correlate with churn risk (realistic, not optimistic)

INSIGHT #3: Strategy Cost Optimization
- Average retention cost: €68 per customer
- Range: €35-106 (AI adjusts based on customer profile and risk level)
- All strategies within budget constraint (€50-100)

INSIGHT #4: Campaign ROI
- For 20 extreme high-risk customers (88.5% avg churn):
  - Investment: €1,368
  - Expected saves: 8.5 customers (42.5% success rate)
  - Revenue saved: €21,250
  - ROI: 1,453%
- Even extreme high-risk retention is profitable!

BUSINESS IMPLICATIONS:
1. Short-term: Deploy AI retention strategies for immediate ROI
2. Mid-term: A/B test strategies to validate success rate assumptions
3. Long-term: Fix onboarding process to prevent customers reaching high-risk state

LIMITATION (Important for transparency):
- Success rates are AI-estimated, not validated with real campaign data
- In production: Implement feedback loop to track actual success rates
- Recommendation: Start with 3-month pilot, measure actual retention, adjust model
